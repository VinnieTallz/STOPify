              Our mission is to empower seniors and travelers to confidently explore Calgary by offering an intuitive,
              icon-driven transit experience that breaks down language barriers and simplifies public transportation for all.
              We are dedicated to inclusivity and accessibility, focusing on developing a user-friendly web-based app that
              provides easy navigation through Calgaryâ€™s transit system. By prioritizing icon-based design, our app ensures
              that users, regardless of language or familiarity, can travel with independence and ease, transforming public
              transit into a simple and empowering experience.
